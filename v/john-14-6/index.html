          <h3>What this means</h3>
          <p>The Lord Jesus spoke these words to His disciples when their hearts were troubled and they did not understand what was coming. When Thomas asked about “the way,” Jesus did not give a method or a set of steps. He gave Himself. He is the way to God, because He is the One who came from the Father and can bring sinners to the Father.</p>
          <p>This verse is clear and personal: “no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” It is not saying that people must become good enough to come. It is saying there is one sufficient Saviour. The gospel is that Christ died for our sins and rose again, and God offers forgiveness and everlasting life to the one who trusts His Son. The question becomes simple: will you come God’s way, through Christ?</p>

          <h3>A simple response</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Stop trusting your own goodness to bring you to God.</li>
            <li>Believe that Christ died for your sins and rose again.</li>
            <li>Come to the Father through Him, trusting Him personally.</li>
          </ul>
