          <h3>What this means</h3>
          <p>This verse is a clear Gospel summary: Christ suffered for sins “once.” His sacrifice was not repeated. It was complete. He is “the just,” and we are “the unjust.” That is, He was righteous and sinless, and we were guilty and undeserving.</p>
          <p>Why did He do it? “That he might bring us to God.” The Gospel is not only forgiveness, but restoration. It brings a sinner into peace with God through the work of Christ. His death was real (“put to death in the flesh”), and His resurrection was real (“quickened by the Spirit”). The risen Christ is the living Saviour who saves all who trust Him.</p>

          <h3>A simple response</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Stop trying to make yourself worthy.</li>
            <li>Rest in Christ’s finished work for you.</li>
            <li>Come to God through Him, in simple faith.</li>
          </ul>
